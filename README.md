# WeCanCharge

We can charge was an app developed in android studio for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Mobile Programming and Advanced Web Design Techniques in the Web Information Systems and Technologies degree at ESMAD.

## About

This project is divided into 3 areas, namely entrepreneurship, programming and design. This repository contains mainly the programming aspect, but we will try to demonstrate a little of the work developed in the other aspects in this read me.

## Behance

UI and UX is a very important part of our application, in addition to being evaluated for it, it was an area where we wanted to learn more and improve.

The application was first designed and idealized in Adobe Xd, after several tests with users and corrections made, we arrived at the following result: [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/99647035/We-can-charge-Mobile-App-UIUX-design)

Part of the developed interfaces is present at behance, but there are more that have been developed that are present in the following file: [Xd File](WeCanCharge.xd)

One of the goals of publishing our work on behance was to use animation to better show the interfaces and interactions. This objective was not entirely possible since we found a problem exporting the gifs in photoshop, there was a limit of colors that it was possible to use and for projects like these that used a lot of gradients it was not possible in the time that we had to find a solution with more quality .

A version with low quality gif parts can be found at: [Behance 2](https://www.behance.net/gallery/99686129/We-can-charge-Mobile-App-UIUX-%28GIF-low-quality%29)
